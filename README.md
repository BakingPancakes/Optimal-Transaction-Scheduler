# Simulated-Database-Concurrency-Scheduler
Given simulated data for a Multi-User Database Management System (DBMS), our algorithm utilizes threads to simulate data access and a scheduler protocol (Timestamp-based and Lock-based Concurrency Control Protocols) allowing multiple users can access data at the same time while ensuring conflicting operations are resolved in an orderly manner.
